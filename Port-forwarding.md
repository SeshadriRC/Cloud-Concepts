Got it — let’s use a clearer example with **different port numbers** so it’s less confusing.

---

### **Scenario**

Inside OpenShift, **Tigera Manager** is running on **port 443** inside the cluster.
You want to access it from your laptop without exposing it publicly.

---

### **Port-forward example**

```bash
oc port-forward svc/tigera-manager 9000:443 -n tigera-operator
```

**Explanation:**

* **9000** → The port on **your local machine** (you can choose any unused port).
* **443** → The port **inside the Tigera Manager service** in the cluster.
* **`-n tigera-operator`** → Namespace where the service is running.

---

### **What happens**

* When you open `https://localhost:9000/dashboard` in your browser:

  * The browser sends traffic to **localhost:9000** (your machine).
  * OpenShift forwards it to **Tigera Manager’s port 443** inside the cluster.
  * You see the Tigera Manager dashboard, even though it’s not exposed to the internet.

---

✅ **Tip:**
You can think of it like this:

> **Local port (first number)** = door you open on your computer.
> **Remote port (second number)** = door inside the pod/service you want to reach.

---

If you want, I can make a **small diagram** showing how port-forward traffic flows from your browser → local port → pod inside OpenShift. That usually makes it click instantly.
