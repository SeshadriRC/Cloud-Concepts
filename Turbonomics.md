**Turbonomic** (now part of IBM) is an **Application Resource Management (ARM)** platform that automatically manages and optimizes compute, storage, and network resources across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

### Key Features of Turbonomic:

* **Automatic Resource Optimization**: Continuously monitors workloads and automatically scales resources (up or down) to ensure performance and efficiency.
* **Cost Control**: Helps reduce cloud and infrastructure costs by rightsizing VMs, containers, and databases based on actual usage.
* **Performance Assurance**: Prevents performance issues by proactively adjusting resources before bottlenecks occur.
* **Integration**: Works with platforms like VMware, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.
* **Policy-Based Actions**: Allows custom policies to control how resources are allocated or scaled.
* **AI-Driven Decisions**: Uses AI and analytics to recommend and execute real-time actions.

### Example Use Cases:

* Scaling down an overprovisioned AWS RDS instance from `db.t4g.2xlarge` to `db.t4g.large`.
* Resizing Kubernetes pods based on usage patterns.
* Balancing workloads across hypervisors to avoid CPU or memory hotspots.

In your context, Turbonomic is monitoring the DB instance's resource usage and automatically resizing it to optimize performance and cost.
