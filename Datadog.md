**Datadog Spike Reasons**

- We observed a Datadog spike originating from DFS Secret Manager version 3.1.5. It was not properly fetching credentials from Vault for the application. To resolve the issue, we instructed the user to use DFS Secret Manager version 3.1.2. After the downgrade, the issue was resolved and no further spikes were observed. 

**Datadog Traces** refer to the **distributed tracing** feature provided by Datadog, a cloud monitoring and observability platform.

## Datadog Traces

### What are Datadog Traces?

* **Distributed Tracing** captures detailed information about requests as they flow through different services and components in a distributed system.
* Each **trace** represents the entire journey of a request, while **spans** are individual units of work within that trace (e.g., a call to a database, an API request, etc.).
* Traces help you **understand latency, performance bottlenecks, and failures** in complex microservices architectures.

### Why use Datadog Traces?

* **Track requests end-to-end:** See how a single request moves across multiple services.
* **Identify performance issues:** Pinpoint slow operations or errors.
* **Improve reliability:** Quickly detect where and why failures happen.
* **Optimize system performance:** Understand service dependencies and optimize workflows.

### How it works:

* Instrument your application code or use auto-instrumentation agents.
* Datadog collects trace data and visualizes it in its dashboard.
* You can drill down into traces to see detailed timing, errors, and metadata.

### Example:

If a user request triggers several microservices and database calls, Datadog Traces lets you see the full timeline and each stepâ€™s duration, helping you find where delays or errors occur.
