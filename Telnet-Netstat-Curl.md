Good question 👍 — both are network-related, but they serve different purposes:

---

### 🔹 **`netstat`**

* **What it does**: Shows network statistics and status.
* **Usage**: Lists sockets, listening ports, established connections, routing tables, interface stats, etc.
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  netstat -tulnp
  ```

  * `-t` → TCP
  * `-u` → UDP
  * `-l` → Listening sockets
  * `-n` → Numeric addresses/ports (no DNS lookup)
  * `-p` → Show process using the port

👉 Used to check **what ports/services are running** on your system and which processes own them.

---

### 🔹 **`telnet`**

* **What it does**: Tries to open a TCP connection to a remote host and port.
* **Usage**: Useful for testing connectivity (like curl but without HTTP parsing).
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  telnet stapp01 5000
  ```

  If successful, it means **network + firewall + service are all OK** for that port.

👉 Used to **test reachability** of a service/port from a client machine.

---

### ✅ Key Difference

* `netstat` = looks **inward**, shows what your server is listening on and which connections exist.
* `telnet` = looks **outward**, tests if you can actually connect to a specific host\:port.

---

Would you like me to also include how `ss` (the modern replacement for `netstat`) fits into this comparison?


Great follow-up 👍

`curl` is different from `telnet` and `netstat` — it’s more application-level.

---

### 🔹 **`curl`**

* **What it does**: A client tool that makes requests to URLs (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.).
* It not only connects to a port but also **speaks the protocol** (e.g., HTTP).
* Can fetch web pages, download files, send POST requests, test APIs, etc.

---

### Example

```bash
curl http://stapp01:5000
```

* This connects to `stapp01` on port `5000`.
* If Apache is running and serving content, you’ll see the HTML output (index page).

---

### ✅ Difference from the others

* **netstat** → shows which ports your server is listening on / connections in use.
* **telnet** → tests basic TCP connectivity to a host/port (but doesn’t understand HTTP).
* **curl** → tests full **application-level communication** (HTTP/HTTPS), so it tells you if the web service is really working.

---

👉 Quick analogy:

* **netstat** = “Which doors are open in my house?”
* **telnet** = “Can I open that door from outside?”
* **curl** = “Once I open the door, can I actually talk to the person inside in their language (e.g., HTTP)?”

Do you want me to also compare `wget` vs `curl` (since both are used for web requests)?
