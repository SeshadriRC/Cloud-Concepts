**Pod crashloopback off**

We observed a CrashLoopBackOff in the pod due to an OOMKilled event. We informed the application team and instructed them to allocate sufficient memory.

**Quota issue**

The application team was unable to deploy the application as it required a large resource quota, while the namespace was allocated with a medium quota. To address this, we increased the quota from medium to large. After the update, the issue was resolved.
