To deploy a web application in OpenShift from a **private JFrog repository**, you need to follow these steps in **sequence**. This assumes your application is packaged as a container image and stored in **JFrog Artifactory**.

---

### âœ… **Prerequisites**

* Namespace: `application-stage` exists.
* You have access to the private JFrog Docker registry (username/password or token).
* The application image is already pushed to JFrog.
* You have the image name and tag, e.g., `mycompany.jfrog.io/my-repo/my-app:latest`.

---

### ðŸš€ **Step-by-Step Deployment**

#### **Step 1: Login to JFrog and Create Secret**

Create a **Docker registry secret** that allows OpenShift to pull from your private JFrog registry.

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry jfrog-secret \
  --docker-server=mycompany.jfrog.io \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password-or-api-key> \
  --docker-email=<your-email> \
  -n application-stage
```

---

#### **Step 2: Link the Secret to Default Service Account**

This allows OpenShift pods in this namespace to use the secret when pulling images.

```bash
oc secrets link default jfrog-secret --for=pull -n application-stage
```

---

#### **Step 3: Create Deployment YAML (Example)**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
  namespace: application-stage
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-webapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-webapp
          image: mycompany.jfrog.io/my-repo/my-app:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: jfrog-secret
```

Save this as `deployment.yaml`.

---

#### **Step 4: Deploy the Application**

```bash
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
```

---

#### **Step 5: Create a Service (Expose the Pod)**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-webapp-service
  namespace: application-stage
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

Save as `service.yaml` and apply:

```bash
oc apply -f service.yaml
```

---

#### **Step 6: Expose the Service via Route (Optional for External Access)**

```bash
oc expose service my-webapp-service -n application-stage
```

It will create a route you can access externally.

---

### âœ… **Verify**

```bash
oc get pods -n application-stage
oc get svc -n application-stage
oc get routes -n application-stage
```

---

### ðŸ§  Notes

* If your image requires SSL validation, make sure OpenShift nodes trust JFrog's certificate.
* You can also use **Helm** or **Kustomize** if the deployment is complex.
* You can define resources, environment variables, liveness/readiness probes as needed.

---

Let me know if your app is not in container form and needs to be built from source instead.
