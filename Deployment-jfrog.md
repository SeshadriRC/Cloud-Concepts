Image


#### **Image**

The **image name** refers to the **full path of the container image** stored in your **private JFrog registry**. The format is:

```
<registry-url>/<repository>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

---

### üîç Example (JFrog-hosted image):

If your JFrog Artifactory is hosted at:
`mycompany.jfrog.io`

And your Docker repository in JFrog is:
`my-docker-repo`

And your image is:
`my-webapp`
And tag is:
`v1.0.3`

Then the full **image name** is:

```bash
mycompany.jfrog.io/my-docker-repo/my-webapp:v1.0.3
```

---

### üîê Important:

* This image must be **pullable** using your credentials.
* You can verify this by doing a local `docker pull`:

```bash
docker login mycompany.jfrog.io
docker pull mycompany.jfrog.io/my-docker-repo/my-webapp:v1.0.3
```

---



To deploy a web application in OpenShift from a **private JFrog repository**, you need to follow these steps in **sequence**. This assumes your application is packaged as a container image and stored in **JFrog Artifactory**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Prerequisites**

* Namespace: `application-stage` exists.
* You have access to the private JFrog Docker registry (username/password or token).
* The application image is already pushed to JFrog.
* You have the image name and tag, e.g., `mycompany.jfrog.io/my-repo/my-app:latest`.

---

### üöÄ **Step-by-Step Deployment**

#### **Step 1: Login to JFrog and Create Secret**

Create a **Docker registry secret** that allows OpenShift to pull from your private JFrog registry.

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry jfrog-secret \
  --docker-server=mycompany.jfrog.io \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password-or-api-key> \
  --docker-email=<your-email> \
  -n application-stage
```

---

#### **Step 2: Link the Secret to Default Service Account**

This allows OpenShift pods in this namespace to use the secret when pulling images.

```bash
oc secrets link default jfrog-secret --for=pull -n application-stage
```

---

#### **Step 3: Create Deployment YAML (Example)**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
  namespace: application-stage
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-webapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-webapp
          image: mycompany.jfrog.io/my-repo/my-app:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: jfrog-secret
```

Save this as `deployment.yaml`.

---

#### **Step 4: Deploy the Application**

```bash
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
```

---

#### **Step 5: Create a Service (Expose the Pod)**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-webapp-service
  namespace: application-stage
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

Save as `service.yaml` and apply:

```bash
oc apply -f service.yaml
```

---

#### **Step 6: Expose the Service via Route (Optional for External Access)**

```bash
oc expose service my-webapp-service -n application-stage
```

It will create a route you can access externally.

---

### ‚úÖ **Verify**

```bash
oc get pods -n application-stage
oc get svc -n application-stage
oc get routes -n application-stage
```

---

### üß† Notes

* If your image requires SSL validation, make sure OpenShift nodes trust JFrog's certificate.
* You can also use **Helm** or **Kustomize** if the deployment is complex.
* You can define resources, environment variables, liveness/readiness probes as needed.

---

Let me know if your app is not in container form and needs to be built from source instead.

The command you posted:

```sh
oc create secret docker-registry jfrog-secret \
  --docker-server=mycompany.jfrog.io \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password-or-api-key> \
  --docker-email=<your-email> \
  -n application-stage
```

is used to **create a Docker registry secret** in OpenShift (or Kubernetes) that stores credentials for pulling images from a **private container registry**, in this case, **JFrog Artifactory**.

| Part                                           | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `oc create secret docker-registry`             | Command to create a secret of type `docker-registry`.                                   |
| `jfrog-secret`                                 | Name of the secret you‚Äôre creating. You can refer to this in your deployment/pod YAMLs. |
| `--docker-server=mycompany.jfrog.io`           | URL of your JFrog Artifactory (or Docker registry).                                     |
| `--docker-username=<your-username>`            | Your Artifactory username.                                                              |
| `--docker-password=<your-password-or-api-key>` | Your password or API key for authentication.                                            |
| `--docker-email=<your-email>`                  | Your email address (required by the Docker config, but not validated).                  |
| `-n application-stage`                         | The namespace where the secret should be created.                                       |

---

### üì¶ Use Case:

If your image is stored in a **private JFrog registry**, OpenShift needs credentials to pull it. This secret provides those credentials.

---

### ‚úÖ Next Step: Link the Secret to Your Deployment

Once this secret is created, you need to reference it in your deployment YAML like this:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: jfrog-secret
```

This tells the pod to use `jfrog-secret` when pulling images.

Let me know if you want a full deployment YAML with the secret referenced.
