### üîπ What is **Ephemeral Storage** in OpenShift?

**Ephemeral storage** is **temporary storage** that a pod uses while it is running. The data stored in ephemeral storage **is lost when the pod is deleted, restarted, or rescheduled**.

---

### üîÅ In Simple Terms:

* Think of ephemeral storage like **writing something on a whiteboard**.
* Once the **pod (whiteboard)** is erased (restarted or deleted), the **data is gone**.

---

### üîπ Where is Ephemeral Storage Used?

1. **EmptyDir volume**
2. **Container writable layer** (e.g., `/tmp`, logs inside the container)
3. **ConfigMap or Secret volumes**
4. **Downward API volumes**

---

### üîß Example: `emptyDir`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: temp-storage-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello > /cache/msg && sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: temp-volume
  volumes:
  - name: temp-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

* This pod creates a **temporary folder `/cache`**.
* That folder exists **only as long as the pod is alive**.

### üîπ Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                         | Why Use Ephemeral Storage?              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Caching                          | Temporary files or results              |
| Intermediate data processing     | Like logs or scratch space for a job    |
| Build containers (e.g., Jenkins) | Workspace directory during build stages |

---

### üî• Important Notes

* **Not persistent** ‚Äì not suitable for databases or critical data.
* Each node has **limited ephemeral storage**, shared across all pods.
* You can **set limits and requests** for ephemeral storage like this:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    ephemeral-storage: "500Mi"
  limits:
    ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
```

### üÜö Ephemeral vs Persistent Storage

| Feature              | Ephemeral Storage              | Persistent Storage               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Duration             | Temporary (pod-lifecycle)      | Long-term (independent of pod)   |
| Data lost on restart | ‚úÖ Yes                          | ‚ùå No                             |
| Backed by            | Node‚Äôs disk or container layer | Volumes like NFS, EBS, OCS, etc. |
| Use cases            | Logs, caches, temp data        | Databases, shared files, backups |
