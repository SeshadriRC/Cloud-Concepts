```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
  namespace: application-stage
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-webapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-webapp
          image: mycompany.jfrog.io/my-repo/my-app:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your YAML file, **`labels`** and **`matchLabels`** serve different but related purposes.

### 🔹 `labels` (under `template.metadata`)

This is where you **assign labels** to the pod that will be created by this deployment. Labels are key-value pairs used to organize, group, and select Kubernetes resources.

```yaml
labels:
  app: my-webapp
```

Here, every pod created by this Deployment will have the label `app=my-webapp`.

---

### 🔹 `matchLabels` (under `selector`)

This tells the Deployment **which pods it should manage** (i.e., select). It’s used by the Deployment controller to identify the pods that belong to this Deployment.

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: my-webapp
```

So, it looks for pods with `app=my-webapp` and considers them under its control.

---

### 🔁 How They Work Together

In this case, the `matchLabels` in the selector **matches the `labels` in the pod template**, which is correct and necessary. This means:

> The Deployment will manage (create, update, delete) pods that have the label `app=my-webapp`.

---

### ✅ Best Practice

Always make sure that:

* The pod template inside the deployment has `labels` set.
* The `selector.matchLabels` matches those same labels.

Otherwise, Kubernetes will not know which pods the deployment should manage, and it will lead to errors.
