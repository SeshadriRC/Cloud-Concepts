### üì¶ Use Cases:

* **Kubernetes Networking**: Ensures pods can reach each other.
* **Microservice Security**: Restricts communication using **network policies**.
* **Hybrid Cloud**: Connects Kubernetes workloads across on-prem, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
* **Compliance**: Helps meet requirements (like PCI, HIPAA) through logging and controls.

### üìå Example: Network Policy

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: backend
```

This policy allows only **backend pods** to talk to **frontend pods**.
