In **OpenShift**, two important concepts that deal with scaling and node provisioning are:

### ðŸ”¹ **MachineSet**

A `MachineSet` is similar to a Kubernetes `ReplicaSet`, but for **nodes** instead of pods. It ensures that a specified number of **worker nodes** are running in the cluster.

#### âœ… Example:

Let's say you want 3 worker nodes with a specific configuration (CPU, memory, region, etc.). You create a `MachineSet`, and OpenShift ensures 3 such machines are running. If one node goes down, it will automatically provision a new one to replace it.

#### Sample MachineSet YAML (simplified):

```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: worker-east
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: worker-east
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: worker-east
    spec:
      providerSpec:
        value:
          instanceType: m5.large
          region: us-east-1
```
