### ðŸ”¹ What is HAProxy in OpenShift?

**HAProxy** in OpenShift acts as the **default router**. It is responsible for **routing external traffic** to the correct **services/pods inside the cluster**.

HAProxy = **High Availability Proxy**
It's a **load balancer and reverse proxy** that OpenShift uses to expose applications running inside the cluster to the outside world.

### ðŸ”¸ Where is HAProxy used in OpenShift?

In OpenShift, HAProxy runs as a **router pod** inside the **`openshift-ingress`** or **`openshift-ingress-operator`** namespace.

When a user accesses a route like:

```
https://myapp.example.com
```

OpenShift's HAProxy router:

1. Receives the request.
2. Matches it to the correct **Route object**.
3. Forwards it to the appropriate **Service**, which sends traffic to the **Pod**.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Example Scenario

Letâ€™s say you create a route for your web app:

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  host: myapp.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: myapp-service
```

When someone opens `https://myapp.example.com`, HAProxy:

* Sees the incoming request.
* Checks if the hostname matches a known route.
* Forwards traffic to `myapp-service`, which sends it to the pod.
