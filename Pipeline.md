In **Jenkins**, a **pipeline** is a series of automated steps that define how software is **built, tested, and deployed**. It allows you to **automate the CI/CD process** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment).

### ðŸ”§ What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A **Jenkins Pipeline** is a **scripted flow** written using **Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language)**, typically stored in a file named `Jenkinsfile`.

### âœ… Basic Concepts:

| Concept         | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Stage**       | Logical division (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy)    |
| **Step**        | Individual tasks (e.g., run script, build code) |
| **Node**        | A machine (agent) where the pipeline runs       |
| **Agent**       | Defines where the pipeline or stage runs        |
| **Jenkinsfile** | File that defines the pipeline and its stages   |

### ðŸ’¡ Example: Simple Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to server...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§± Types of Pipelines:

1. **Declarative Pipeline** (Recommended)

   * Uses structured `pipeline {}` block
   * Easier to read and maintain

2. **Scripted Pipeline**

   * Uses more flexible Groovy syntax
   * Good for complex logic

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Jenkins Pipelines?

* **Code as configuration** (`Jenkinsfile`)
* **Version-controlled CI/CD**
* Supports **parallel stages**
* Better **error handling** and **stage visibility**
* Easier to maintain and scale CI/CD processes
