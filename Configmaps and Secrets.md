In OpenShift (and Kubernetes), **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** are used to **externalize configuration** and **sensitive data**, so that your application pods can be configured **without changing code**.

---

## üîπ What is a **ConfigMap**?

A **ConfigMap** is used to store **non-sensitive configuration data** in **key-value pairs**.
Think of it like a **settings file** (like `.env` or `app.config`).

### ‚úÖ Examples of what you store in a ConfigMap:

* Application settings (`ENV=prod`)
* Config files
* URLs, ports, file paths
* Feature flags

---

### üîß Sample ConfigMap YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-app-config
data:
  APP_ENV: production
  APP_PORT: "8080"
  LOG_LEVEL: debug
```

---

## üîπ What is a **Secret**?

A **Secret** is like a ConfigMap but used to store **sensitive data**, such as:

* Passwords
* Tokens
* TLS certificates
* Database credentials

Secrets are **base64 encoded** (not encrypted by default, but safer than plain text).

---

### üîê Sample Secret YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: dXNlcm5hbWU=     # base64 of 'username'
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=     # base64 of 'password'
```

> You can create secrets using plain text too, via `kubectl create secret`.

## üì¶ How to Use ConfigMaps & Secrets in Pods

You can use them in 3 ways:

| Method            | Use Case                       | Example                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Env Variable**  | Inject as environment variable | `env:` in pod spec                 |
| **Mounted File**  | Mount as files in container    | `volumeMounts` and `volumes`       |
| **CLI Reference** | Directly in app logic          | App reads from environment or path |

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Use ConfigMap in Pod

```yaml
env:
  - name: APP_ENV
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-app-config
        key: APP_ENV
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Use Secret in Pod

```yaml
env:
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-secret
        key: password
```

## üîÅ Key Differences

| Feature        | ConfigMap                  | Secret                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Stores         | Non-sensitive data         | Sensitive/confidential data        |
| Encoding       | Plain text                 | Base64-encoded                     |
| Type           | `ConfigMap`                | `Opaque`, `dockerconfigjson`, etc. |
| Use case       | App configs, env variables | Passwords, keys, tokens            |
| Access control | Normal                     | More restricted (RBAC recommended) |

In **OpenShift** (and Kubernetes), a **pull secret** is a credential that allows the cluster to authenticate to a container registry in order to pull images.

The **default-generated pull secret** is the one that OpenShift automatically creates for every new project/namespace. It‚Äôs called:

```
default-dockercfg-<random_suffix>
```

### Key Points:

* It is **automatically generated** by OpenShift when a new namespace is created.
* It contains a reference to the cluster-wide **global pull secret** (`/var/lib/kubelet/config.json`) that was configured during OpenShift installation.
* It allows workloads (Pods, Deployments, etc.) in that namespace to pull images from:

  * The **internal OpenShift registry** (so apps can pull images built and pushed by Builds or Pipelines).
  * Any external registries specified in the cluster‚Äôs global pull secret (e.g., `quay.io`, `registry.redhat.io`, or private registries).
* The service account `default` in each namespace automatically gets this pull secret attached, meaning **Pods can pull images without you explicitly creating a secret**.

üëâ Example:

```bash
oc get secrets
```

Might show:

```
NAME                         TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-dockercfg-abc12      kubernetes.io/dockercfg               1      2m
```

So, in short:
üîπ **default-generated pull secret** = namespace-level secret that lets pods pull images using the cluster‚Äôs global authentication.
