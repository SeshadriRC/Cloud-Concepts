I had seen teams stepping on each other's code, and when the code breaks or when the merge conflicts pop up or your feature gets tangled, nobody is quite sure which code is ready for production and which is still a work in progress. It’s frustrating for every team and slows down delivery, and sometimes even breaks things in production.

The Solution: Branching Strategies
The good news is that there is a solution having a smart branching strategy. It is a rulebook that decides how and where developer should branch, work, and merge their code. These strategies keep the code organised, help teams avoid conflict, and let everyone know what is safe to deploy for your production environment.

Gitflow Workflow:
Gitflow introduces structure with main branches (master and develop) and special-purpose branches for features, release, and hot fixes. New works start in a feature branch, get tested on develop, and only the tested and best code lands in the master branch for release.

Pros:
Great for big teams and projects needing strict release cycles

Supports parallel work with little risk to production code

Organizes hotfixes and releases clearly

Cons:
Can become complex with lots of branches

More steps to merge and release, so development can feel slow

Not ideal if you’re aiming for fast, continuous delivery


GitHub Flow:
Github Flow keeps it simple. Create a feature branch from main (master), make changes, get them reviewed, and then merge straight back into your master branch. The code is always ready to deploy.

Pros:
Quick and easy to follow, ideal for small teams or web apps

Encourages frequent deployments and fast feedback

Less overhead, fewer steps

Cons:
Not suited for managing multiple release versions

Without strict checks, risky code can sneak into production

As the team grows, there can be more merge conflicts


GitLab Flow:
GitLab flow combines ideas from Gitflow and GitHub flow, and it focuses on environment-based branches instead of maintaining many long-lived branches. Environment branches like production, staging, and pre-production to match deployment environments.

Pros:
Adapts as your team and projects grow

Handles complex deployment environments well

Works nicely with DevOps and automation

Cons:
Steeper learning curve at first

It can be too intricate if you don’t need the extra flexibility

More process, so it might slow you down early on


Trunk Based Development
Trunk-based development is a simplified branching mode where all developers integrate their work into a single shared branch (the trunk), usually main or master. Instead of long lived feature branch, changes are small, frequent, and short-lived, merged into the trunk branch multiple times a day.

Pros:
Super fast and great for continuous integration and deployment

Merge conflicts are rare since everyone rebases often

Encourages collaboration, everyone’s code is always fresh

Cons:
Demands discipline and strong automated testing

Harder to manage for teams not used to real-time collaboration

Not ideal if you need strict control for releases or long-lived features


After all my ups and downs, here is what I can say that there is no perfect branching strategy. The branching strategy depends on your project and your goals. Start simple and don’t be afraid to switch things up if it is not working for you, and remember, the best strategy is the one that everyone actually follows.
