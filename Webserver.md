Perfect üëç let‚Äôs start with the basics.

## **What is a Web Server?**

A **web server** is software (and sometimes the hardware too) that **delivers web pages** to users over the internet or a private network.

When you type a website like `http://example.com` in your browser:

1. Your browser sends an **HTTP request** to the server.
2. The **web server software** (like Apache, Nginx, IIS) receives that request.
3. It looks up the requested resource (like `index.html` or `index.php`).
4. It sends the response (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) back to your browser.

### **Two meanings of "Web Server"**

1. **Software** ‚Üí The program that handles requests (Apache, Nginx).
2. **Hardware** ‚Üí The actual physical machine (or VM) where the web server software runs.

### **Main functions of a web server**

* **Serve static content** ‚Üí HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images.
* **Handle dynamic content** ‚Üí Work with PHP, Python, Java apps, etc.
* **Support HTTPS** ‚Üí Secure connections with SSL/TLS.
* **Load balancing & reverse proxy** (in advanced cases).
* **Logging & monitoring** of requests.

### **Examples of web servers**

* **Apache HTTP Server** (very popular, older, widely used).
* **Nginx** (modern, lightweight, often used as reverse proxy + web server).
* **Microsoft IIS** (Windows).

üëâ So, **a web server is basically the middleman between your browser and the website‚Äôs files/applications**, making sure you see the webpage when you request it.

Would you like me to now compare **Apache vs Nginx** in simple terms (like when to use which)?
