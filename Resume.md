What i have done
4. S3 bucket creation, uploading dumps in S3 bucket and deletion of files


## Argo

- Argo install and Upgrade

## OCP

### User Management

- Roles and Rolebinding creation

### Compute

- Quota modifictions ( from small to large )
- Scale up the machineset because of insufficient CPU
- Cordon/drain the node
- Worker node resizing

### Workloads

- Pod got in stuck state , so i terminated gracefully

### Administration

- Namespace deletion

## RDS

- DB parameter group creation
- Provision of resource using cloud formation
- DBparametergroup quota exceeded, so we need to go AWS services and need to submit the request
- RDS DB creation and Deletion using cloudformation template
- User have done the upgrade, but it had not reflected in OCP console, so i will do troubleshooting

## Vault
- vault mount path creation for the DB using stack id
- Provided credentials of database using hashicorp
